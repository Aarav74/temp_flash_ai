* **Voice Input Support:** Utilize speech-to-text functionality for hands-free messaging.
* **Authentication:** Secure user authentication using Email/Password and Google Sign-In powered by Firebase Authentication.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Switch between elegant dark and light themes for personalized viewing.
* **Animated Lightning Logo:** A visually appealing animated lightning bolt serves as the app's logo and an interactive element.
* **Introductory Screen:** A "Flash Intro Screen" provides a warm welcome and highlights the app's key features.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run FLASH AI on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (Stable channel recommended)
* [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
* A Google account for Firebase and Google Sign-In.
* An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API Key for AI model access.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/flash-ai.git](https://github.com/your-username/flash-ai.git)
cd flash-ai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Click "Add project" and follow the steps to create a new project.

2.  **Add Apps to Firebase Project:**
    * **Android:** Add an Android app. Use `com.example.flashai` (or your chosen package name) as the Android package name. Download `google-services.json` and place it in `android/app/`.
    * **iOS:** Add an iOS app. Use `com.example.flashAi` (or your chosen bundle ID) as the iOS bundle ID. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in `ios/Runner/`.
    * **Web:** Add a Web app. Copy the Firebase configuration object.

3.  **Enable Authentication Methods:**
    * In the Firebase Console, navigate to "Authentication" > "Sign-in method."
    * Enable **Email/Password** and **Google** sign-in providers.

4.  **Generate `firebase_options.dart`:**
    * Run the FlutterFire CLI command to generate the Firebase options file:
        ```bash
        flutterfire configure
        ```
    * This will create `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your project's Firebase configurations.

### 4. OpenRouter API Key Setup

1.  **Get an OpenRouter API Key:**
    * Sign up or log in to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
    * Navigate to your dashboard or API key settings to generate a new API key.

2.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    * In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env`.
    * Add your OpenRouter API key to this file:
        ```
        OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
        ```
    * **Important:** Do not commit your `.env` file to version control. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
flutter run
```
